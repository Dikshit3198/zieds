#zieds

zieds (Latvian for flower) is a lightweight library that implements a basic bloom 
filter in C. Currently supports strings/ints.

##About

A bloom filter is a compact way to test whether an element is a member of a set. The 
filter uses m bits (16 in this implementation) per element to represent n elements by 
hashing ni with k (optimal value (m / n) * ln(2)) different hash functions and 
setting the bit at every respective hash value. To determine if an element is 
present, the filter hashes the desired element with the k hash functions and tests 
the bit at each hash value. If any of these are clear, the filter knows the element 
is not a member of the set. Insertion and querying a bloom filter are both O(k).

##Hashing

Instead of defining k independent hash functions, this implementation generates them 
via:

g<sub>i</sub>(x) = h<sub>a</sub>(x) + i * h<sub>b</sub>(x) % m, where i ranges from 
[0:k)

h<sub>a</sub>(x) - Murmur3 32-bit

h<sub>b</sub>(x) - FNV1A 32-bit

##Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/grifhughes/zieds
```

##Usage
```
/* initialize */
struct bloom_filter *bf;
BLOOM_INIT(bf); /* default handles 100 element sets */

/* add some numbers */
bloom_insert_int(bf, 4);
bloom_insert_int(bf, 20);
bloom_insert_int(bf, 500);

/* prints 1 0 1 */
printf("%d %d %d\n", bloom_query_int(bf, 4), 
        bloom_query_int(bf, 100),
        bloom_query_int(bf, 500)); 

/* free */
BLOOM_FREE(bf);
```
